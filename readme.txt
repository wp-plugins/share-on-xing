== Description ==

This plugin enables the XING Share Button and the Follow Button on your Wordpress website. It allows to include the buttons on your home page, pages and/or posts. It also enables widgets and handy shortcodes. Your visitors will be able to share your content on their news feed, as well as start following your News or Company page on XING.

= XING Share button =

The main feature of this plugin allows you to include the XING Share Button on your posts and pages. You'll find all the configuration options under the `XING for WP` menu option on your WP Admin interface.

= XING Share shortcode =

Add a XING Share Button using a shortcode inside your post or theme. The button generated by the shortcode can be configured individually.

`[xing_share]`

Optional configuration:

The `layout` option defines the look of the button, determined by counter position and shape. Possible values are:

With counters

* `share-top` rectangular shape, "Share"/"Teilen" labeled, with counter balloon on top
* `share-right` rectangular shape, "Share"/"Teilen" labeled, with counter balloon on the right
* `square-top` square shape, no label, with counter balloon on top
* `square-right` square shape, no label, with counter balloon on the right

Without counters

* `share` rectangular shape, "Share"/"Teilen" labeled
* `square` square shape, no label

The `lang` option defines the language in which the information shown by the button is displayed. Default value is `en` (English), can be set to `de` (German).

The `url` option defines the URL to be shared when clicking the button. Needs to be a valid URL. Current URL is used if none is provided.

The `follow_url` option sets the URL of the XING News or Company page for the [Follow button](https://dev.xing.com/plugins/follow) displayed on the success page after sharing.

Here’s a full example:

`[xing_share layout="share-top" lang="de" url="https://wordpress.org/plugins/share-on-xing/" follow_url="https://www.xing.com/news/pages/marketing-werbung-44"]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is there no content shown on the preview when sharing? How do I customize what is shared? =

The XING Share Button uses the Open Graph tags on your page header to gather the title, the description and an image (if any) and use them to build the shared item. If these are not present, no information will be shown within the preview. There are several plugins which might help you setting the Open Graphs tag headers properly.
