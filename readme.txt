== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is there no content shown on the preview when sharing? How do I customize what is shared? =

The XING Share button uses the Open Graph tags on your page header to gather the title, the description and an image (if any) and use them to build the shared item. If these are not present, no information will be shown within the preview. There are several plugins which might help you setting the Open Graphs tag headers properly.
